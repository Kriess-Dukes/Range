/**
 * 3: range()
 *
 *  a. Create a function called range that takes two integers as 
 *  parameters and returns an Array containing all integers 
 *  between the two parameters, inclusively.  For example:
 *
 *      range(8, 14);  // => [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
 *
 *  BONUS: If the first argument is greater than the second, 
 *  return the range in reverse order, ie:
 *
 *      range(14, 8);  // => [14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8]
 *
 *  TIPS:
 *  a. create something to collect the output you'll return.
 *  b. you'll need a loop, which one is best?
 *  c. you'll wanna make use of the push() method of Array.
